# VarAD
[IEEE TII] Official Implementation for "VarAD: Lightweight High-Resolution Image Anomaly Detection via Visual Autoregressive Modeling"

~~Thank you all for your interest! Code will be released before February.~~


## Status Update:
In recent months, Mamba has undergone significant improvements. However, our current code is still based on the previous version of Mamba, which can be difficult to install. As we are currently focused on graduation, we require additional time to adapt our code to work with the updated Mamba version.

Although our code is not fully organized yet, we have uploaded it for those interested in exploring our work. Please feel free to take a look!
